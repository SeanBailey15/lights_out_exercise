# Lights Out

## Description

This is an exercise for the Springboard Software Engineering Bootcamp. In this exercise students are tasked with creating a React application that replicates the Lights Out handheld logic game from the 90's. See if you can turn all the lights out!

## Goal

The goal of this exercise is to get hands on experience with the `useState` function of React, and how it pertains to mutable data structures.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/SeanBailey15/lights_out_exercise.git <optional_custom_directory_name_here>
    ```

2. Navigate into the directory:

    ```bash
    cd lights_out_exercise
    ```
    OR
    ```bash
    cd <your_custom_directory_name>
    ```

3. Install the required packages:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4. Launch the game:

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

5. Enjoy!

## How to Play

The goal is to turn all of the lights out. When you click on a light, it will toggle either on or off.

**But there's a catch!**

The light above, below, to the left, and to the right will ALSO be switched on/off!!!

Do your best to outsmart the grid.

## Good Luck!
